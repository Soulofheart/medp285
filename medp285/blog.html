<h1>The Machine Stops by E.M. Forster MEDP 285</h1>

<div>It is almost unbelievable that the reading is from 1909. The topic about the struggle of opression
  seems still so present especially in times of Covid-19 and police brutality. The genre science fiction is for sure
  helpless to create a timeless story. Another aspect is the struggle between machine and human which is especially
  impressive when you remember that the work was written 1909. The author desribes the machine as something
  that controlls the humans life and suggest that humans can't live without a machine. A very present
  picture comes to mind when reflecting on this thought is seeing everybody hanging over their phones
  even though that many people feel more alone than ever.</div>
